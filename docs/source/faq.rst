What Django ERP framework is not?
---------------------------------

Django ERP framework is not a ready made ERP solution, rather, a framework that provide you tools to build one effortlessly and in style.
To check how easy it is, go through the tutorial. By the end of it, you'd have a working sales monitor app with
a dozen reports and charts in couple of hours.

How this project got started ?
------------------------------

The author (@RamezIssac) always worked in the field of ERP/accounting solutions since in 2002.
This framework was triggered by author work to supply an ERP solution to a big holding company in Python and Django.

Then the framework got loaded with ERP different modules (sales / purchases / payment / General ledger etc...)
and it's not till November 2019 that was decided to open source the core.

After that decision was made, the author went on and removed all "specific" modules which contained many assumptions,
simplified the api, substitute paid libraries with open source ones, write a tutorial / documentation and .... here we are :)


In April 2020, the Django ERP framework reporting engine was released as a standalone package. Django Slick Reporting.

In May 2023 this project was renamed from `django-ra-erp` to `django-erp-framework`.


What's the meaning of "Ra" ?
